---- 4.3 Using C++ for host programs
+--- 4.3 Defining shared libraries
+
+	Objects with extension .so are considered shared libraries, and
+	will be compiled as position independent objects.
+	Kbuild provides support for shared libraries, but the usage
+	shall be restricted.
+	In the following example the libkconfig.so shared library is used
+	to link the executable conf.
+
+	Example:
+		#scripts/kconfig/Makefile
+		hostprogs-y     := conf
+		conf-objs       := conf.o libkconfig.so
+		libkconfig-objs := expr.o type.o
+
+	Shared libraries always require a corresponding -objs line, and
+	in the example above the shared library libkconfig is composed by
+	the two objects expr.o and type.o.
+	expr.o and type.o will be built as position independent code and
+	linked as a shared library libkconfig.so. C++ is not supported for
+	shared libraries.
